//Implicit treap is a simple modification of the regular treap
//which is a very powerful data structure. In fact, implicit
//treap can be considered as an array with the following procedures 
//implemented (all in O(logN) in the online mode):
//• Inserting an element in the array in any location
//• Removal of an arbitrary element
//• Finding sum, minimum / maximum element etc. on an arbitrary interval 
//• Addition, painting on an arbitrary interval
//• Reversing elements on an arbitrary interval

//Here is an example implementation of the implicit treap with 
//reverse on the interval. For each node we store field called 
//value which is the actual value of the array element at current
//position. We also provide implementation of the function output(),
//which outputs an array that corresponds to the current state of the implicit treap.

//The idea is that the keys should be indices of the elements in the array.
//But we will not store these values explicitly 
//(otherwise, for example, inserting an element would cause changes of the key in O(N) nodes of the tree).
//Note that the key of a node is the number of nodes less than it 
//(such nodes can be present not only in its left subtree but also in left subtrees of its ancestors). 
//More specifically, the implicit key for some node T is the number of vertices cnt(T → L) 
//in the left subtree of this node plus similar values cnt(P → L) + 1 for each ancestor
//P of the node T, if T is in the right subtree of P. Now it’s clear how to calculate
//the implicit key of current node quickly. Since in all operations we arrive to any node by 
//descending in the tree, we can just accumulate this sum and pass it to the function. 
//If we go to the left subtree, the accumulated sum does not change, if we go to 
//the right subtree it increases by cnt(T → L) + 1.

//Insert element.Suppose we need to insert an element at position pos.
//We divide the treap into two parts, which correspond to arrays [0..pos-1]
//and [pos..sz]; to do this we call split (T, T1, T2, pos). Then we can 
//combine tree T1 with the new vertex by calling merge (T1, T1, new_item)
//(it is easy to see that all preconditions are met).

//Reverse on the interval.
//This is again similar to the previous operation:
//we have to add boolean flag ‘rev’ and set it to true when
//the subtree of the current node has to be reversed. “Pushing”
//this value is a bit complicated - we swap children of this node 
//and set this flag to true for them.
void reverse (pitem t, int l, int r) {
	pitem t1, t2, t3;
	split (t, t1, t2, l);

	t2->rev ˆ= true; merge (t, t1, t2); merge (t, t, t3);

}



//Delete element. This operation is even easier: find the element 
//to be deleted T, perform merge of its children L and R, and replace
//the element T with the result of merge. In fact, element deletion in 
//the implicit treap is exactly the same as in the regular treap.



//Find sum / minimum, etc. on the interval.
//First, create an additional field F in the item structure to store
//the value of the target function for this node’s subtree. This field
//is easy to maintain similarly to maintaining sizes of subtrees: create
//a function which calculates this value for a node based on values for 
//its children and add calls of this function in the end of all functions
//which modify the tree.
//Second, we need to know how to process a query for an arbitrary interval [A; B].
//To get a part of tree which corresponds to the interval [A; B], 
//we need to call split (T, T1, T2, A), and then split (T2, T2, T3, B - A + 1):
//after this T2 will consist of all the elements in the interval [A; B], and only 
//of them. Therefore, the response to the query will be stored in the field F of the 
//root of T2. After the query is answered, the tree has to be restored by
//calling merge (T, T1, T2) and merge (T, T, T3).



//Addition / painting on the interval. We act similarly to the previous 
//paragraph, but instead of the field F we will store a field add which 
//will contain the added value for the subtree (or the value to which the
//subtree is painted). Before performing any operation we have to
//“push” this value correctly - i.e. change T → L → add and T → R → add,
//and to clean up add in the parent node. This way after
//any changes to the tree the information will not be lost.
